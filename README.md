# TasteBud

This is a food ordering online application using React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a fictional restaurant called "TasteBuds".




## Requirements

- The application should allow users to browse through a menu of food items categorized by different types(e.g., appetizers, main course, desserts).

- Users should be able to add items to their cart, specify quantities, and view the total cost of their order.

- The application should have a checkout page where users can enter their contact information and choose a delivery or pickup time.

- Implement a basic JSON backend using json-server to store  the menu data.
