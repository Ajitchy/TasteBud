                            elangana Governor on Saturday approved the names of Amer Ali Khan and Prof M Kodanda Rama Reddy as Members of the Legislative Council (MLC) under the Governor's quota after they were nominated by the ruling Congress.

                            According to a government order, Amer Ali Khan and Prof M Kodanda Rama Reddy replaced former MLCs--D Rajeshwar Rao and Farooq Hussain-- whose term in the council expired on May 27, 2023.

                            "As per sections 156 and 157 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (Central Act 43 of 1951), the term of the member to be nominated by the Governor will be six years from the date of issue of notification under section 74 of the said Act," the government's order said.

                            The 40-member Telangana Legislative Council currently has 24 Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) members, followed by four nominated members. The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) has two members.
                            Additionally, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Telangana Jana Samithi (TJS) each have one member.
                            D(U) president Nitish Kumar on Sunday took oath as Bihar Chief Minister for a record ninth time after snapping ties with the 'Mahagathbandhan' and the Opposition-led INDIA bloc. Nitish Kumar rejoined the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA, which he had dumped less than 18 months ago.

                            Kumar was sworn in by Bihar Governor Rajendra Arlekar at Raj Bhavan in the presence of senior leaders including BJP national president J P Nadda, hours after he resigned from the post. The JD(U) president ditched the 'Mahagathbandhan' saying "things were not working well" for him in the Grand Alliance and Opposition bloc INDIA.

                            Along with Nitish Kumar, several leaders of the BJP, JD(U), Hindustan Awam Morcha and an Independent legislator took oath today. Nitish Kumar's new Cabinet now has two BJP leaders serving as deputy chief ministers.
